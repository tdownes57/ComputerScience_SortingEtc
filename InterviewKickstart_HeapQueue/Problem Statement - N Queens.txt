n Queen Problem

Given an integer n, find all the possible ways to position n queens on an n×n chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

A queen in chess can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Do solve the problem using recursion first even if you see some non-recursive approaches.

Example One

Input: 4

Output: There are two distinct ways four queens can be positioned on a 4×4 chessboard without attacking each other. They may appear in the output in any order so the two valid outputs are:

[
["--q-", "q---", "---q", "-q--"], 
["-q--", "---q", "q---", "--q-"]
]

]

and

[ ["-q--", "---q", "q---", "--q-" ], 
["--q-", "q---", "---q", "-q--" ]
]



Example Two

Input: 2



Output: [ ]

No way to position two queens on a 2×2 chessboard without them attacking each other - so empty array.



Notes

Input Parameters: Function has one argument: n.



Output: Function must return a two-dimensional array of strings representing the arrangements. Size of the array must be m×n where m is the number of distinct arrangements. Length of each string must be n and the strings’ characters may be either ‘q’ (for a queen) or ‘-’ (for empty position on the chessboard). Valid arrangements may appear in the output in any order.



Constraints:

1 <= n <= 12


Custom Input

Custom Input Format:

First and only line of input contains integer n. For example: 4



Custom Output Format: For every one of m valid arrangements (if any), output must include n+1 lines. Of those n+1 lines first n must have n character each, representing rows of the chessboard; the last, (n+1)-th, line must be empty in every one of the m arrangements.

Total number of lines in the output must be m*(n+1).

For input n=4 one correct output is:

-q--
---q
q---
--q-

--q-
q---
---q
-q--

(note an empty line between the “chessboards” and another one at the end)
