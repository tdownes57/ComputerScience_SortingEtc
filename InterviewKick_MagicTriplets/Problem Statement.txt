3 Sum





Problem Statement:



Given an integer array arr of size n, find all magic triplets in it.



Magic triplet is a group of three numbers whose sum is zero.



Note that magic triplets may or may not be made of consecutive numbers in arr.



Input Format:



Function has one argument: array of integers arr.



Output Format:



Function must return an array of strings. Each string (if any) in the array must represent a unique magic triplet and strictly follow this format: “1,2,-3” (no whitespace, one comma between numbers).



Order of the strings in the array as well as order of the integers in any string is insignificant. For example, if [“1,2,-3”, “1,-1,0”] is a correct answer, then [“0,1,-1”, “1,-3,2”] is also a correct answer.



However any two triplets that only differ by order of the numbers are considered duplicates, and duplicates must not be returned. In other words, if triplet “1,2,-3” is a part of an answer, then none of “1,-3,2”, “-3,2,1”, etc may appear in the same answer (though any one of them may appear instead of “1,2,-3”). 



Constraints:



1 <= n <= 2000
-1000 <= any element of arr <= 1000
arr may contain duplicate numbers.
arr is not necessarily sorted.


Sample Input 1:



arr = [10, 3, -4, 1, -6, 9]



Sample Output 1:



[“10,-4,-6”, “3,-4,1”]



Sample Input 2:



arr = [12, 34, -46]



Sample Output 2:



[“12,-46,34”]



Sample Input 3:



arr = [0, 0, 0];



Sample Output 3:



[“0,0,0”]



Sample Input 4:



arr = [-2, 2, 0 -2, 2];



Sample Output 4:



[“2,-2,0”]





Custom Input Format:



First line of input contains integer n.

Next n lines each contain an element of arr.



For example, custom input for arr = [10, 3, -4, 1, -6, 9] would be:



6

10

3

-4

1

-6

9



Custom Output Format:



Output must contain as many lines as there are strings in the answer. Each line (if any) must contain a string representing a unique magic triplet.



For the sample input described above, one correct output is:



10,-4,-6

3,-4,1



another example of a correct output for that input is:



1,3,-4

-4,-6,10
